# Introduction
Openjob is a distributed, high-performance task scheduling framework that supports various types of scheduled tasks, delayed tasks, and workflow design. It adopts a decentralized architecture and implements a consistency sharding algorithm at the bottom level, supporting unlimited expansion.

## Features
### High reliability
It adopts a distributed, stateless design, the Master/Worker architecture, and relies only on one database (MySQL/PostgreSQL/Oracle).

### High performance
It supports precise task scheduling up to second-level granularity, lightweight distributed computing, and uses a consistency sharding algorithm at the bottom level. It supports unlimited expansion.

### Scheduled scheduling
It supports various types of scheduled tasks, including distributed scheduled tasks, fixed-frequency tasks, high-performance second-level tasks, one-time tasks, and more.

### Distributed computing
It supports various distributed programming models, such as single machine, broadcast, Map, MapReduce, sharding, and easily implements large-scale distributed computing.

### Workflow
It has a built-in workflow scheduling engine, supporting a visual DAG design, and efficiently implementing complex task scheduling.

### Delayed tasks
It implements high-performance delayed tasks based on Redis. The bottom-level task adopts a multi-level storage method and provides rich task management.

### Cross-language
It supports client SDKs for multiple programming languages, such as Java/Go/PHP/Python, and can be used in common frameworks like Spring Boot, Gin, Swoft, and more.

### Permission management
It features a very convenient namespace design and adopts rich button-level permission management.

### Alarm monitoring
It has comprehensive monitoring metrics and rich and timely alarm methods, which can help operations and maintenance personnel quickly locate and solve online problems.
